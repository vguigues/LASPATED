Rio de Janeiro emergency data with hexagonal discretization

Files:
info.dat:
    T G R P nb_regressors nb_holidays
    nb_obs_monday nb_obs_tuesday ... nb_obs_sunday

T: Number of half hour periods per day
G: Number of days in the week
R: Number of subregions in the space discretization
P: Number of calls priorities

nb_obs_day: Number of observations for each week day


calls.dat:
    t g r p j val h
    t: index of half hour period
    g: index of week day
    r: index of subregion
    p: index of call priority
    j: index of non null observation
    val: number of calls in the j-th observation for the index (t,g,r,p)
    h: holiday index (-1 if no holiday)

neighbors.dat:
    id lat long type reg1 reg2 reg3 reg4 reg5 id_neighbor1 dist_neighbor1 ... id_neighborN dist_neighborN

    id: subregion id
    lat, long: centroid of subregion
    type: type of subregion
    regI: value of regressor I=1,...,5. 
        First three regressors represent areas of subregion with:
            reg1 -> public activities
            reg2 -> Non-developed land. Woods, rivers, etc.
            reg3 -> Residential areas.
        Fourth and fifth regressors represent population values.
    id_neighborI, dist_neighborI: list of neighbors of current subregion
