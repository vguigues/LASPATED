    Generate a hexagonal discretization of the area using Uber's H3 library

    Parameters
    ----------
    param gdf: GeoDataFrame
        Original geodataframe whose boundaries will be considered to generate the discretization
    param resolution: int
        Desired resolution level passed to the H3 library. A bigger number means smaller hexagons.

    Returns
    -------

        New GeoDataFrame containing the H3 hexagons that approximately cover the original region
