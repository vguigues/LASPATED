# How to run the replication script

In order to run the replication script you must install the laspated package and compile the C++ code. If you haven't done it already, you can install the laspated package from the Replication directory by running:

    pip install ../laspated

You can compile the C++ code from the Replication directory by running the command:

    make -C cpp_tests

The cpp_tests directory contains a Makefile that can be edited by the user that compiles the C++ script.  The Makefile inside directory cpp_tests access the environment variable $GUROBI_HOME. If it is set, then the code for the model with Covariates inside laspated.h is accessible. Otherwise, the script will not run the experiments that uses covariates.

After the C++ code is successfully compiled, you can run the replication script by simply running:

    python replication_script.py

This command will generate discretizations using the laspated python module, run the experiments with the C++ code and processing the results generating the figures and tables presented in the paper.


## Results

All results presented in the paper are saved in the directory replication_results, with subdirectories plots and tables. If you want access to the raw data generated by C++, check the directory cpp_tests/results with subdirectories for each experiment made.
