-- How to run the replication script

The first step is to compile the C++ code. This can be done by running the command:

$ cd Replication
$ make -C cpp_tests

The cpp_tests directory contains a Makefile that can be edited by the user that compiles the C++ script.  The Makefile inside directory cpp_tests access the environment variable $GUROBI_HOME. If it is set, then the code for the model with Covariates inside laspated.h is accessible. Otherwise, the script will not run the experiments that uses covariates.

After the C++ code is successfully compiled, you can run the replication script by simply running:

$ python replication_script.py

This command will generate discretizations using the laspated python module, run the experiments with the C++ code and processing the results generating the figures and tables presented in the paper.


-- Results

All results presented in the paper are saved in the directory replication_results, with subdirectories plots and tables. If you want access to the raw data generated by C++, check the directory cpp_tests/results with subdirectories for each experiment made.
